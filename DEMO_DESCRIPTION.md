# Demo Execution Description

## What You're Observing

The demo execution consists of two distinct phases that showcase WALT's advanced tool execution capabilities. In the first phase, you observe a local HTML demo page (demo_page.html) opening in a Chrome browser window. This page serves as the test environment for demonstrating WALT's features. After a brief loading period, you see WALT automatically clicking the "Load Dynamic Content" button, which triggers an asynchronous content loading mechanism. The success message that appears below the button confirms that the click action was successfully executed, demonstrating WALT's ability to interact with web elements deterministically. This initial phase also showcases the retry policy in action—if the button click fails initially due to transient issues (such as the element not being immediately visible or the page still loading), WALT automatically retries the action up to four times with a 1.5-second delay between attempts, ensuring robust execution even when facing temporary failures.

The second phase begins when the first browser window closes and a new window opens, representing the actual WALT tool execution engine in action. The rapid succession of HTML pages opening and closing in the same tab is WALT executing a series of deterministic tool steps, each logged with detailed metadata including step index, type, description, execution time, success/failure status, and the current URL. This phase demonstrates multiple core features simultaneously: the step-level logging system captures every action with precise timing information, the retry policy handles any transient failures automatically, the wait_for_element feature ensures the tool waits for dynamically loaded content to appear before proceeding, and the scroll_into_view feature automatically scrolls to bring off-screen elements into the viewport. The swift page transitions you observe are WALT navigating through the tool definition, executing each step (navigation, wait, click, input, scroll) in sequence, with each step being logged and monitored. The window closing after a few seconds indicates successful completion of the tool execution, with all steps having been processed and logged according to the configured execution parameters. This demonstration illustrates how WALT transforms high-level tool definitions into reliable, observable, and resilient browser automation workflows, making it suitable for both technical and non-technical users who need to automate web-based tasks with confidence and transparency.
