# Demo Execution Description

## What You're Observing

The demo execution consists of two distinct phases that showcase WALT's advanced tool execution capabilities. In the first phase, you observe a local HTML demo page (demo_page.html) opening in a Chrome browser window. This page serves as the test environment for demonstrating WALT's features. After a brief loading period, WALT attempts to automatically click the "Load Dynamic Content" button, which triggers an asynchronous content loading mechanism. This initial phase demonstrates the **retry policy** feature in action—if the button click fails initially due to transient issues (such as the element not being immediately visible or the page still loading), WALT automatically retries the action up to four times with a 1.5-second delay between attempts, ensuring robust execution even when facing temporary failures. The console logs show detailed step-by-step execution information, including each retry attempt, demonstrating WALT's resilience and observability.

The second phase represents the actual WALT tool execution engine in action. During this phase, you observe the browser executing a series of deterministic tool steps, each logged with detailed metadata including step index, type, description, execution time, success/failure status, and the current URL. This phase demonstrates multiple core features simultaneously: the **step-level logging** system captures every action with precise timing information (visible in the console output with `[STEP]` prefixes), the **retry policy** handles any transient failures automatically (showing retry attempts in the logs), the **wait_for_element** feature ensures the tool waits for dynamically loaded content to appear before proceeding (if the button click succeeds), and the **scroll_into_view** feature automatically scrolls to bring off-screen elements into the viewport (for the submit button at the bottom of the page). If you observe blank pages or rapid page transitions, these are typically browser context initialization artifacts or pages that would be used for subsequent steps—the actual feature demonstrations occur through the visible page interactions (button clicks, form filling, scrolling) and are comprehensively logged in the console output. The window closing after execution indicates completion of the tool execution, with all steps having been processed and logged according to the configured execution parameters. This demonstration illustrates how WALT transforms high-level tool definitions into reliable, observable, and resilient browser automation workflows, making it suitable for both technical and non-technical users who need to automate web-based tasks with confidence and transparency.
